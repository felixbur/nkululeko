; Example INI file for predicting speaker ID using SEGMENT module (pyannote)
; This looks for different speakers WITHIN each file

[SEGMENT]
; Use pyannote for speaker diarization (requires HuggingFace token)
method = pyannote
; Output suffix for segmented files
segment_target = _segmented
; Apply to all samples

[MODEL]
; HuggingFace token required for pyannote model
; Get yours at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
; hf_token = <your_huggingface_token>
; Use GPU for faster processing (pyannote is slow on CPU)
